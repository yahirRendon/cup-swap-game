<p align="center">
  This Cup Swapping Game is a logic-based puzzle inspired by online videos. Individuals use two sets of real cups,
  one set serving as the target pattern and the other as the player's attempt to match it. In these challenges, the
  target set is hidden from the guesser and only visible to an observer or audience. After each attempt, the guesser
  is told how many cups in their arrangement match the correct color and position of the target set. Using this
  limited feedback, the player must deduce the exact sequence of the target pattern through logic and elimination.
